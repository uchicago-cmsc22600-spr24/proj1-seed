# Project 1

The source code is located in subdirectories of the `src` directory;
use the `Makefile` to build it.  The executable will be added to the
`bin` directory.

**NOTE:** you must have the location of SML/NJ in your shell `PATH`
variable for the build chain to work.

The `.gitignore` file will prevent generated files (*e.g.*, the generated
lexer or the executable) from being added to the repository.
